# 0w9's custom keymap.

Hiya! This is my custom made keymap.
I have added some cool things there such as layers or send commands. 
This is all experimental so flash it on your own risk.

The whole firmware is based on the ai03/Soyuz MacroPad, which is my first ever build. 

## Overview of the functions

- [X] Custom tool keymap

    Please note that the first layer already has some of the most useful tools, etc.
    The other layers are just used for commands or functions you do not use typically, but it's nice to have 
    to save time when looking for them on StackOverflow.

  - [ ]Â Second layer 
    - The second layer has a keymap for Github
